Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------

1. Find out how to add modules to SS and add module as per usual.

2. Review configs and add entries to mysite/_config/config.yml
(or similar) as necessary.
In the _config/ folder of this module
you can usually find some examples of config options (if any).

The main thing here is that you add an orderstep in your config files.

See _config/EcommerceDeliveryElectronic.yml.example for an example.

Without adding that order step you will not be able to use this module.

All other settings are optional.
